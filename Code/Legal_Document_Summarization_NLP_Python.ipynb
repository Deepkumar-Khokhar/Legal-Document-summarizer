SCHEDULE 1 (SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PARTICULARS) 1.\tSpecification of Software [Specify Software] 2.\tThird Party Materials [Identify Third Party Materials] 3.\tTimetable [Insert timetable] 4.\tFinancial provisions [Insert financial provisions]  Free software development agreement: drafting notes Software development contracts can be both legally and factually complex, and it is almost always a good idea to set out the basis upon which the software is being developed in a written contract. Our aim in preparing this template was to simplify the contractual provisions while producing a document that was flexible enough for use in a wide range of situations. The basic obligations of the developer here are to produce software meeting a written specification and to deliver that software to the customer by some agreed means, all within a pre-defined timetable. The developer's obligations are, however, subject to the customer performing its obligations under the agreement - e.g. providing feedback or content - on time. Software development agreements may provide that copyright and other intellectual property rights in the software are assigned or licensed to the customer. More complex agreements may provide for a combination of licensing and assignment. This agreement assumes that rights in the software will be assigned to the customer, although third-party code and other third-party materials included with the software may be carved out from the assignment. This template is equivalent to our basic software development agreement. The only difference is that this template includes a section crediting/attributing the template to us. Please use the basic contract if you want to remove that section. The standard and premium software development agreements that we publish include a range of clauses that are omitted from this template. The omitted clauses cover user acceptance testing, set up of the software in the customer's environment or a cloud environment, payment of expenses by the customer, the retention and delivery of timesheets by the developer, obligations of confidentiality, indemnities, and many other matters besides. DATE Insert the date of execution of the document. PARTIES Subsection 1 Is the Developer an individual or a company? What is the full name of the individual (including middle names)? What is the postal address of the Developer? What is the full company name of the Developer? In which jurisdiction is the Developer incorporated? What is the registration number of the Developer?

Clause 10: Warranties Clause 10.1 Optional element. What general warranties will the Developer give to the Customer? Clause 10.2 Optional element. What warranties in relation to the quality of the software will the Developer give to the Customer? Is this warranty subject to a materiality threshold? Will this warranty relate to a specific period? For what period will this warranty apply? Clause 10.3 Optional element. Should this warranty cover documentation? What is the scope of this warranty? Clause 10.4 Optional element. Should this warranty cover documentation? What is the jurisdictional coverage of the warranty? Clause 10.5 Optional element.

Should there be an express requirement for the Developer to act reasonably in relation to the exercise of its rights under this provision? Are there any express limitations on this right to modify? Specify the limitations on the right to modify. Clause 10.6 Optional element. Clause 11: Limitations and exclusions of liability Contractual limitations and exclusions of liability are regulated and controlled by law, and the courts may rule that particular limitations and exclusions of liability in contracts are unenforceable. The courts are particularly likely to intervene where a party is seeking to rely on a limitation or exclusion of liability in its standard terms and conditions, but will also sometimes intervene where a term has been individually negotiated. The courts may be more likely to rule that provisions excluding liability, as opposed to those merely limiting liability, are unenforceable. If there is a risk that any particular limitation or exclusion of liability will be found to be unenforceable by the courts, that provision should be drafted as an independent term, and be numbered separately from the other provisions. It may improve the chances of a limitation or exclusion of liability being found to be enforceable if the party seeking to rely upon it specifically drew it to the attention of the other party before the contract was entered into. Exclusions and limitations of liability in UK contracts are primarily regulated by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (\"UCTA\"). Contracts regulated by UCTA cannot exclude or restrict a party's liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence (Section 2(1), UCTA). Except insofar as the relevant term satisfies the requirements of reasonableness, such contracts cannot exclude or restrict liability: (i) for negligence (which includes a breach of an express or implied contractual obligation to take reasonable care or exercise reasonable skill) (Section 2(2), UCTA); or (ii) for misrepresentation (Section 3, Misrepresentation Act 1967). In addition, if a contract is regulated by UCTA, and one of the parties is dealing on the other's written standard terms of business, then except insofar as the relevant contractual term satisfies the requirements of reasonableness the other party cannot: (i) exclude or restrict its liability in respect of a breach of contract; or (ii) claim to be entitled to render a contractual performance substantially different from that which was reasonably expected of it; or (iii) claim to be entitled, in respect of the whole or any part of its contractual obligation, to render no contractual performance at all (see Section 3, UCTA). UCTA includes various other restrictions, particularly in the case of contracts for the sale of goods and contracts under which possession or ownership of goods passes. If you wish to try to limit/exclude for liability in respect of reckless, deliberate, personal and/or repudiatory breaches of contract, you should specify this in relation to the relevant provision. In many circumstances, however, the courts will find these types of limitations and exclusions to be unenforceable. Somewhat different rules apply to limitations of liability in contracts with consumers, and these provisions should not be used in relation to such contracts. These guidance notes provide a very incomplete and basic overview of a complex subject. Accordingly, you should take legal advice if you may wish to rely upon a limitation or exclusion of liability. Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 - https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1977/50 Clause 11.1 Do not delete this provision (except upon legal advice). Without this provision, the specific limitations and exclusions of liability in the document are more likely to be unenforceable. Clause 11.3 Which of the parties will be the beneficiary of this limitation of liability? Clause 11.4 Optional element. Which of the parties will be the beneficiary of this limitation of liability? Clause 11.5 Optional element. Which of the parties will be the beneficiary of this limitation of liability? Clause 11.6 Optional element.

Liability caps may be unenforceable in practice. Which of the parties will be the beneficiary of this liability cap? Do you want to include a per event liability cap in this document? What monetary amount should be used in the liability cap? What floating amount should be used in the liability cap? Clause 11.11 Optional element. Do you want to include an aggregate liability cap in this document? Liability caps may be unenforceable in practice. Which of the parties will be the beneficiary of this liability cap? What monetary amount should be used in the liability cap? What floating amount should be used in the liability cap? Clause 12: Force Majeure Event Optional element. Clause 12.1 Will obligations to make payments be excluded from the scope of the force majeure exception? Clause 12.2 Optional element. Clause 12.3 Optional element. Clause 13: Termination Clause 13.1 Optional element. What notice period will apply? Clause 13.2 Optional element. What notice period will apply? Clause 13.3 In what circumstances may a party terminate for breach? Will all breaches, or only material breaches, give rise to a right of termination? What is the remediation period here? Should each party have a right to terminate if the other party is persistently in breach of contract, even where there has been no material breach? Clause 13.4 Depending upon the status of the parties, the circumstances of the termination and the applicable law, some of the rights to terminate set out here may be unenforceable. Will the winding up of a party as part of a solvent company reorganisation give rise to a right of termination for the other party? Clause 13.5 Optional element. What notice period applies in the case of termination for non-payment? Clause 14: Effects of termination Clause 14.3 Optional element. This provision will not be suitable in all circumstances. The appropriate treatment of charges upon termination will vary from contract to contract. Note, also, that this provision only deals with charges in respect of services. Within what period following termination must charges in respect of services be settled? Clause 15: Further assurance Optional element. Clause 15.1 Is the Developer's obligation here absolute or qualified? What standard of effort should be applied to the obligation? Clause 15.2 Optional element. Which party will pay the costs and expenses associated with any assistance under this provision? Clause 15.3 Optional element. Who will pay for the Developer's assistance?

Insert all required addressee, address and contact details for contractual notices sent to the Customer. Clause 17: Subcontracting Optional element. Clause 17.1 Will the Customer only be permitted to withhold consent to subcontracting where it is reasonable to do so? Clause 17.1 Will the Developer be obliged to notify the Customer of any subcontracting arrangements? Clause 18: General Clause 18.1 Optional element. Clause 18.2 Optional element. Clause 18.3 Optional element. This is intended to prevent, for example, one party wrongfully claiming that a term of the contract was changed in a telephone call. Clause 18.4 Optional element. Clause 18.5 Optional element. This provision is designed to exclude any rights a third party may have under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999. Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 - https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/31 Clause 18.6 Optional element. Clause 18.7 This template has been drafted to work in the English law context. If you plan to change the governing law, you should have the document reviewed by someone with expertise in the law of the relevant jurisdiction. Which law will govern the document? Clause 18.8 Optional element. As a practical matter, it makes sense for the courts with expertise in the relevant law to have the right to adjudicate disputes. Where one of the parties is outside England (or at least the UK), you may want to grant the courts of their home jurisdiction the right to adjudicate disputes, as this could ease enforcement in some circumstances. The courts of which jurisdiction will have the exclusive right to adjudicate disputes relating to the document (subject to applicable law)? Clause 19: Interpretation Should provisions concerning the interpretation of the document be included? Clause 19.1 Optional element. Clause 19.2 Optional element. Clause 19.3 Optional element. Clause 19.4 Optional element. This provision is designed to exclude the application of a rule of interpretation known as the ejusdem generis rule. That rule may affect the interpretation of contractual clauses that list particular examples or instances of some more general idea, by limiting the scope of the general idea by reference to those particular examples or instances.
